# GoCD Server Docker image

An Alpine Linux based docker image for [GoCD server](https://www.gocd.io).

# Usage

Start the container with this:

```
docker run -p8153:8153 -p8154:8154 gocd/gocd-server
```

This will expose container ports 8153(http) and 8154(https) onto your server. You can now open http://localhost:8153 and https://localhost:8154

## Available configuration options

## Mounting volumes

The GoCD server will store all configuration, pipeline history database, artifacts, plugins, and logs into `/godata`. If you'd like to provide secure credentials like SSH private keys among other things, you can mount `/home/go`

```
docker run -v /path/to/godata:/godata -v /path/to/home-dir:/home/go gocd/gocd-server
```

## Tweaking JVM options (memory, heap etc)

JVM options can be tweaked using the environment variable `GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES`.

```
docker run -e GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="-Xmx4096mb -Dfoo=bar" gocd/gocd-server
```

# Under the hood

The GoCD server runs as the `go` user, the location of the various directories is:

Directory           | Description
--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`/home/go`          | the home directory for the GoCD server
`/godata/artifacts` | the directory where GoCD artifacts are stored
`/godata/config`    | the directory where the GoCD configuration is store
`/godata/db`        | the directory where the GoCD database and configuration change history is stored
`/godata/logs`      | the directory where GoCD logs will be written out to
`/godata/plugins`   | the directory containing GoCD plugins
# Troubleshooting

## The GoCD server does not come up

- Check if the docker container is running `docker ps -a`
- Check the STDOUT to see if there is any output that indicates failures `docker logs CONTAINER_ID`
- Check the server logs `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID tail -f /godata/logs/go-server.log` (or check the log file in the volume mount, if you're using one)
